Welcome to Aeropress Dice!

This application was inspired by the real product released a few years ago. Aeropress Dice utilizes React, react-three-fiber, and use-cannon to create an interactive user experience. You can move the table around, pan the camera, zoom into the dice, and roll them. Each dice has a diferent aspect of an Aeropress recipe on it; water temperature, coffee to water ratio, grind size/brew time, inverted/standard position, and stir technique. If a recipe that interests you is rolled, you can save it! 

Run 'npm install' to download the required packages for this application.
To save a recipe you will need to clone the back end https://github.com/victorscholz/aeropress-dice-back-end, and run 'rails s'
